# React-Native-Jokes-Accordion

This is a React Native app that displays a list of categories fetched from an API and allows the user to expand and collapse each category to show a list of jokes associated with that category. The app features a "swap to top" functionality that swaps the selected category with the top category in the list. It also includes a modal that displays the text of the selected joke when clicked. The app's styles are defined in a stylesheet and optimized for different screen sizes.

Here are the steps to run application:
1.	Make sure Node.js and React Native CLI are installed on your computer.
2.	Clone or download the React Native application repository that you want to run.
3.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the React Native application is stored.
4.	Run the command npm install or yarn to install all the necessary dependencies.
5.	If you want to run the application on an Android emulator, open the emulator first. If you want to run the application on a physical Android device, make sure USB debugging is enabled on the device.
6.	Run the command react-native run-android to run the application on an emulator or Android device. If you want to run the application on iOS, use the command react-native run-ios.
7.	Wait for a few moments until the compilation and installation process is complete. After that, the application will run on the selected emulator or physical device.
