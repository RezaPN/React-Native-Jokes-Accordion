# React-Native-Jokes-Accordion

This is a React Native app that displays a list of categories fetched from an API and allows the user to expand and collapse each category to show a list of jokes associated with that category. The app features a "swap to top" functionality that swaps the selected category with the top category in the list. It also includes a modal that displays the text of the selected joke when clicked. The app's styles are defined in a stylesheet and optimized for different screen sizes.
